Stanley Bruce (1883â€“1967) was the eighth Prime Minister of Australia, serving from 1923 to 1929. He was a barrister and businessman before being wounded in the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I.
Elected to parliament in 1918 as a member of the Nationalist Party, he served as treasurer in the government of Billy Hughes before replacing him as prime minister in 1923.
Bruce overhauled federal government administration and oversaw its transfer to the new capital, Canberra.
His "men, money and markets" scheme was an ambitious attempt to rapidly expand Australia's population and economic potential through massive government investment and closer ties with Great Britain and the rest of the British Empire.
But his heavy-handed response to industrial unrest and attempts to overhaul labour laws led to a landslide defeat in 1929. After politics, Bruce became involved with the League of Nations until the outbreak of World War II.
After the war, he was a leading advocate of development aid, a founder of the Food and Agriculture Organization, the first chancellor of the Australian National University and the first Australian to sit in the House of Lords (as Viscount Bruce of Melbourne).
